<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal pumps</li><li>Displacement pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural pumps market is primarily categorized into two types: centrifugal pumps and displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move water, making them efficient for high-flow applications, such as irrigation. They are commonly used due to their adaptability and ease of maintenance. Displacement pumps, on the other hand, function by creating a vacuum or using mechanical action to move fluids, making them ideal for precise applications like transferring viscous liquids or handling varying flow rates. Both types play crucial roles in modern agriculture.</p></p>
