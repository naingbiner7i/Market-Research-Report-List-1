<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer's Disease Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cholinesterase Inhibitors</li><li>NMDA Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's disease drugs market includes two primary types: cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, improve cognitive function by increasing levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter associated with memory. NMDA antagonists, like memantine, work by regulating glutamate activity, which helps protect brain cells from damage and may improve overall cognition in moderate to severe cases. Together, these drug classes aim to manage symptoms and enhance quality of life for patients.</p></p>
