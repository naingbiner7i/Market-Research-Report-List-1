<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piezoelectric Inkjet Print-heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Inkjet</li><li>Random Inkjet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Piezoelectric inkjet print-heads are categorized into two main types: continuous inkjet (CIJ) and random inkjet (also known as drop-on-demand). Continuous inkjet technology works by generating a steady stream of ink droplets that are electrically charged and directed towards the substrate, allowing for high-speed printing. In contrast, random inkjet print-heads eject droplets only when needed, providing greater precision and flexibility for various applications. Both types leverage piezoelectric materials to control droplet formation and achieve superior print quality.</p></p>
